{"name":"Videoviewcontroller","tagline":"Using AVPlayerViewController with Swift and iOS","body":"### Welcome to Video View Controller.\r\nThis is a simple controller class to make using AVPlayerViewController easier.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nI struggled with this for a while before finding the right solution. Mostly I pulled it together sing StackOverflow and docs and wanted to give back.\r\n\r\n### How to use this\r\nYou will need to create a `AVPlayerViewController` in Storyboard, connect it with a Segue (I use a modal segue for video display). And you'll need a valid NSURL. Pass both to the `VideoDetailViewController` constructor `init(avVideoViewController:AVPlayerViewController, videoURL:NSURL)`. It'll just look after itself from there on in. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can find the author @charlespsdowd on GitHub.
